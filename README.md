# 05 Work Day Calander

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a simple calender application using the base code provided. The Day.js library is used to compare the current time to the time blocks on the calender and color code them accordingly. The user can then enter an event into the time block and save it to local storage. When the page is refreshed the saved events persist.

## User Story

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
